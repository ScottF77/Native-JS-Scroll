# Native-JS-Scroll
Scroll down a page using JavaScript not JQuery

This is a basic function that moves the window down to a target, these need to be set within the JS.

The function works out if the page needs to stop before the end of the page or whether it needs to just scroll to the bottom.

I need to add a timing function and easing.
